    "performance_summary": "LTIMindtree concluded FY25 with 5% YoY CC revenue growth and a 14.5% EBIT margin. While growth was strong in H1, it slowed in H2 due to macro uncertainties. Key verticals and a major geography performed well. Order inflow was robust at $6B, driven by AI-led deals. Operating margins declined YoY. Headcount increased, and attrition remained stable.",

      "latest_quarter": {
        "narrative": "Q4 FY25 revenue declined 0.7% QoQ in USD terms and 0.6% in CC terms, but increased 1.1% QoQ in INR terms. EBIT margin remained flat at 13.8% QoQ. PAT increased 3.9% QoQ in INR and 2% QoQ in USD, with PAT margin improving to 11.5% from 11.2% in Q3. YoY, Q4 revenue grew 5.8% in USD and 6.3% in CC terms. EBIT margin declined YoY, while PAT margin also declined. Key drivers for these changes include macro uncertainty impacting deal closures and ramp-ups, successful completion of productivity pass-backs to a key client, and ongoing cost optimization initiatives. \n\nSuitable Charts:\n* Bar chart comparing USD Revenue, INR Revenue, EBIT (INR), and PAT (INR) across Q4 FY24, Q3 FY25, and Q4 FY25.\n* Line chart showing EBIT margin and PAT margin trends across the same periods."

      "full_year": {
        "narrative": "FY25 revenue grew 4.8% YoY in USD terms and 5% in CC terms. EBIT margin declined to 14.5% from 15.7% in FY24, primarily due to wage hikes, productivity pass-backs, and macro-related project delays. PAT saw a marginal increase of 0.4% YoY, with PAT margin declining to 12.1% from 12.9%. Key influencing factors include cost optimization initiatives, strategic deal wins in key verticals, and the impact of deal ramp-up delays due to the uncertain macro environment."

    },
    "segment_geographic_deep_dive": "BFSI, Technology, and Manufacturing verticals, which contribute ~80% of revenue, performed well in FY25. BFSI grew 4.6% YoY, driven by large deals focused on cost optimization and tech modernization. Technology grew 8.7% YoY, with continued momentum expected. Manufacturing grew 7.2% YoY, driven by vendor consolidation and ERP transformation deals. Consumer business remained flat YoY in CC terms, with growth in Retail and CPG offset by client-specific slowdowns in Travel, Transportation, and Hospitality. Healthcare declined 3% YoY. Geographically, North America grew 7.1% YoY, while Europe and Rest of World declined. Client-specific issues impacted Travel and Transportation in FY25.",
    "deal_wins_pipeline_quality": "LTIMindtree recorded a strong order book in FY25, with $6B in TCV, a 6.1% YoY increase. Q4 order inflow was $1.6B, the second consecutive quarter above $1.5B. The deal pipeline remains robust. There\u0027s a shift towards longer-term, efficiency-driven deals, reflecting the current macro environment. Key wins include deals in life insurance, energy, financial services, life sciences, and digital services, many involving AI solutions.",
    "management_commentary_outlook": "Management is confident in navigating macro challenges and expects growth to return in Q1 FY26, driven by deferred deals and new opportunities. Margins are also expected to improve from Q1 onwards due to the Fit4Future cost optimization program. Venu Lambu, the new CEO, outlined three key initiatives for FY26: sales transformation, focusing on adapting to the AI economy and expanding client base; revamping the large deal organization to address evolving client needs; and the Fit4Future program to enhance agility and profitability. Management is optimistic about the order book growing further in FY26, driven by strong deal pursuits, especially in the retail sector.",
    "comparison_to_expectations": "While management expressed optimism about growth momentum in Q3, Q4 FY25 revenue growth fell short of expectations due to macro uncertainties and deal delays. However, the company successfully completed productivity initiatives for a key client as planned.",
    "key_risks_headwinds": "Management acknowledges the ongoing macro uncertainty as a key headwind, impacting deal closures, ramp-ups, and discretionary spending. Client-specific slowdowns in certain sectors like Travel and Transportation also pose challenges.",
    "operational_efficiency": "DSO improved by a day in Q4 compared to Q3. Utilization excluding trainees increased slightly QoQ. Attrition remained stable at 14.4%. LTIMindtree onboarded 4,700 freshers in FY25 as part of its pyramid correction strategy. The Fit4Future program aims to improve operational efficiency further by optimizing team structures, reducing layers, and leveraging AI for innovation."
